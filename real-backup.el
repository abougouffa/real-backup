;; URL: https://github.com/abougouffa/real-backup

;;; Commentary:

;; This is a fork and reviving of [`backup-each-save'](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BackupEachSave).

;; Ever wish to go back to an older saved version of a file?  Then
;; this package is for you.  This package copies every file you save
;; in Emacs to a backup directory tree (which mirrors the tree
;; structure of the filesystem), with a timestamp suffix to make
;; multiple saves of the same file unique.  Never lose old saved
;; versions again.

;; To activate globally, place this file in your `load-path', and add
;; the following lines to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'real-backup)
;;     (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'real-backup)

;; To activate only for individual files, add the require line as
;; above to your ~/.emacs, and place a local variables entry at the
;; end of your file containing the statement:
;;
;;     (add-hook (make-local-variable 'after-save-hook) 'real-backup)
;;
;; NOTE:  I would give a full example of how to do this here, but it
;; would then try to activate it for this file since it is a short
;; file and the docs would then be within the "end of the file" local
;; variables region.  :)

;; To filter out which files it backs up, use a custom function for
;; `real-backup-filter-function'.  For example, to filter out
;; the saving of gnus .newsrc.eld files, do:
;;
;;     (defun real-backup-no-newsrc-eld (filename)
;;       (cond
;;        ((string= (file-name-nondirectory filename) ".newsrc.eld") nil)
;;        (t t)))
;;     (setq real-backup-filter-function 'real-backup-no-newsrc-eld)

;;; ChangeLog
;; - v1.0 -> v1.1:  added `real-backup-filter-function'
;; - v1.1 -> v1.2:
;;   - added real-backup-size-limit
;;   - fixed "Local Variables" docs, which was inadvertently being activated
;; - v1.2 -> v1.3:  fix for some emacsen not having `file-remote-p'
;; - v1.3 -> v1.4:  added footer and autoload
;; - v1.4 -> v2.0:  refactor, deprecate old Emacs
;; - v2.0 -> v2.1:
;;   - more features and tweaks
;;   - add `real-backup-cleanup' and `real-backup-auto-cleanup'
;;   - add `real-backup-open-backup'
;; - v2.1 -> v3.0:  rebrand the package as `real-backup'
;; - v3.0 -> v3.1:  add compression support
